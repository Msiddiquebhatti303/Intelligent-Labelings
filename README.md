# Intelligent-Labelings
A smart labeling solution that leverages automation and intelligence to efficiently tag, organize, and manage datasets for AI/ML projects.
Intelligent Labeling
📌 Introduction

Data labeling is one of the most time-consuming and expensive steps in building machine learning models. The Intelligent Labeling project aims to simplify this process by introducing automation, smart annotation techniques, and efficient file management to help developers and researchers prepare clean datasets with less manual effort.

🚀 Features

Automated Labeling – Reduce manual work by applying pre-trained models or rule-based labeling.

File Upload & Commit Support – Easily upload files, commit changes, and keep track of dataset versions.

Flexible Dataset Management – Organize, categorize, and update datasets without losing previous progress.

AI/ML Ready – Designed to integrate seamlessly with AI/ML workflows for training and validation.

Scalable & Extensible – Works for small projects as well as large-scale datasets.

🛠️ Use Cases

Preparing labeled datasets for computer vision tasks such as image classification, detection, and segmentation.

Organizing text datasets for NLP applications like sentiment analysis or entity recognition.

Managing custom data pipelines for research projects and experiments.

Building educational demos to showcase data annotation techniques.
